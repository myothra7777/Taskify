# Taskify

A task management app written in Dart using Flutter created in order to help a user organize personal tasks as well as to allow a supervisor to assign employees tasks to complete at work. Having a record of all current and past tasks will allow workflow to run smoothly and prevent employees from forgetting to complete and assignment or failing to follow up on something.
